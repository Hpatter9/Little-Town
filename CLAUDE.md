# Chronos Settlement (formerly Little Town)

A pixel-art town that runs itself, like an ant farm. It's played mainly as a phone web app (a PWA on the
owner's Android, hosted on GitHub Pages). There's also a Windows desktop overlay (Electron): a strip above the
taskbar. TypeScript + PixiJS. `DESIGN.md` is the original design, and `README.md` covers how to play and build.

## Priorities (from the owner)

- **Phone first.** Design every change for the phone version. Before calling anything done, check it at phone
  sizes both upright (393x852) and sideways (852x393) in a browser preview.
- **Hands-off.** The town decides for itself what to research, gather, build and craft
  (`src/shared/sim/planner.ts`). The player only sets the town's **direction** (Growth, Defence, Trade or
  Knowledge, in the Plan tab) and sends **expeditions**. Don't add chores or manual controls.
- **Deaths should be common.** Raids, disasters and hunger are meant to bite.
- **Assets.** The project is free and private, so any sprite from the asset packs may be used. Credit the source
  in `CREDITS.md`. The packs live in the private repo `hpatter9/chronos-assets` (clone it next to this one, at
  `../chronos-assets`); copy in only the individual sprites the game uses, never whole packs. Sprites the game uses
  are in `src`. Images load through `art/loadImage.ts` (a refused `decode()` falls back to the load event).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm test               # headless sim tests (node test runner)
npm run web            # build the phone version into out/web (what GitHub Pages serves)
npm run build          # build only (desktop + renderer) into out/
npm run dist           # Windows installer (needs Windows; not for the cloud)
```

To preview the phone version, serve `out/web` with any static server and open it at a phone size.
`window.__game` is the game loop (`__game.sim.step()` fast-forwards), and `window.bridge.openPanel('build')`
opens a menu. Never launch Electron; the owner runs the desktop app themselves.

## Layout

- `src/shared/sim/`: the deterministic simulation. It runs at 10 ticks a second, with 600 ticks per game hour
  and 3-day seasons.
  - `sim.ts`: the step order.
  - `planner.ts`: the self-running town. It can be turned off with `state.autopilot = false`; the tests' `plainGame`
    helper does this.
  - `people.ts`: jobs and tasks.
  - `snapshot.ts`: what the renderers see.
  - `save.ts`: save versions and migrations.
- `src/shared/data/`: buildings, research, items, the world map spots, founding (backgrounds and scenarios), and
  so on.
- `src/renderer/`: the town strip.
  - `main.ts`: input, the phone's tap card and pinch.
  - `town/`: the views: sky, weather, seasons (via `art/palette.ts`).
  - `panel/`: the menus.
  - `mobile/`: the phone page. It holds the strip and the menus in two iframes that share one bridge;
    `mobileBridge.ts` runs the game in the page and saves to `localStorage`.
- `src/main/`: the Electron desktop app.
- `tools/build-web.mjs`: the phone build (manifest, offline service worker, icons).

## Conventions

- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` after changes, and add tests for new rules in `test/`.
- After CSS changes, check the braces balance and that each `@media` block holds only what it should. A broken
  `@media` block once wrecked the phone layout.
- Saves on the phone use the keys `littletown.*`, and the desktop uses `%APPDATA%\Little Town`. Keep both, or
  existing towns are lost.

## Current work: the ant-farm redesign

- **Phase 1 is done:** the self-running town, direction, and a zoomed-out phone view with pinch-to-zoom.
- **Phase 2 is done:** coins and a shop (`src/shared/sim/shop.ts`, data in `src/shared/data/shop.ts`).
  - The planner researches Barter and builds a Trading Post, which grows by upgrade (General Store, then Emporium).
    Straight away if the land can't give what it needs (`unsourced`).
  - It crafts furnishings (items with `furnish` in `data/items.ts`), and the shopkeeper (an operator role) sets them
    out on the shop's floor grid (`shopLayout`). Appeal: more travellers, bigger purses.
  - Travellers (`s.travellers`) walk in, trade at the shop, and walk out. The planner decides what's for sale
    (`forSale`) and what to buy (`shoppingList`). Materials travellers sell count as sourceable once there's a
    shop, which is how desert towns get fiber.
  - Attractiveness (`attractiveness()`: appeal plus `s.renown`) sets the customer tiers that come (`CUSTOMER_TIERS` in
    `data/shop.ts`: travellers, merchants, nobles, magnates). Higher tiers want wares (items with `ware` in
    `data/items.ts`, unlocked by research). Served, renown rises; disappointed, it falls.
  - The planner makes wares from spare materials only, spends coins on the shop (`planShop`: extensions when crowded,
    else piece levels), and weights research toward wares for tiers it draws but can't serve (`wareGaps`).
  - Venues are general (`floor.venue` in `data/buildings.ts`: `shop` or `tavern`; the tavern chain is Fireside Inn →
    Tavern). They start bare; furnishings are commissioned (`CraftOrder.for`) only when the town can pay, and crafters
    are paid (`payCrafter` in `crafting.ts`). Renown, the log and unmet wants (`asked`) live on each venue's `b.shop`.
  - Strangers (`Traveller`) have a name, temper and `want`; keepers upsell on Social (`talkChance`). Tavern guests need
    comfort (`req`).
  - Quality (`data/quality.ts`, 8 grades) is rolled from Crafting skill; inventory qualities live in `s.itemQ`
    (kept in step by `qualitiesOf`), worn ones in `p.gearQ`.
  - Wages and gear buying: `sim/wages.ts`. With a shop, `equipAll`/`pickTool` stop handing gear out. The daily ledger
    is `s.ledger` (`earn` in `state.ts`); per-person activity is `p.recent` (`remember`).
  - Research: one person per station (`researchStations`, `freeStation`, `topicFor` in `research.ts`); the research
    task carries its station and topic.
  - The lich path: `offerLichRite`/`chooseLich`/`watchLich` in `occult.ts`, `s.lichChosen` then `s.lich` (permanent).
    `snapshot.theme` is `'lich'` once it's set; `src/renderer/theme.ts` holds the look (one stylesheet scoped to
    `html.theme-lich`) and the menus' new names, applied by the phone page, the panels and the strip's HUD.
  - The bird's-eye interior is the `shop` and `tavern` panels (`src/renderer/panel/shopPanel.ts`), opened by tapping the shop.
  - All the new state fields are optional (no save version bump): old saves load with no coins and no shop.
- **Menus take the whole screen on the phone** (the `menu-open` class in `mobile/index.html`): the town runs
  itself, so there's little to watch while a menu is open. The tabs stay visible (along the bottom upright).
- **Phase 3 is done** (the Tavern: see above).
- **Origins are done:** `src/shared/data/origins.ts` (defs: start, rules, powers), applied at founding in
  `newGame`; the rule multipliers are in `src/shared/sim/origin.ts` (asked for by people, farming, raids, crafting, the
  shop, townsfolk); powers in `src/shared/sim/powers.ts` (`castPowers`, cast by the town itself; buffs in `s.buffs`);
  looks in `src/renderer/theme.ts` (one palette per origin, CSS generated and scoped to `html.theme-<id>`, menu names,
  building tint), and each origin's menu materials and shapes in `src/renderer/skins.ts` (appended to the theme's
  CSS: small inline SVGs; use `pseudo()` to put `::after` on a selector list). Undead and machines are both
  `tireless` (state.ts).
- **Rival origins are done:** `src/shared/data/rivals.ts` (each origin's lord, army and hostile spells), raid kinds
  `rival_*` in `data/raids.ts` (with `origin` and `leader`; never picked for the town's own origin), enemies and
  relics in `data/enemies.ts` and `data/items.ts`. `src/shared/sim/rivals.ts` casts the lords' spells
  (`rivalsInRaid`) and holds the hexes on `Raid.hex` that raids.ts and powers.ts read (`heldBack`, `fogAim`,
  `wardOf`, `frenzyOf`, `turretsDown`).
- **Spell visuals:** casts are recorded with `castSpellFx` (state.ts: caster, targets by id, how long) from
  `castPowers` (the `TOUCH` table in powers.ts says what each power touches) and `rivalsInRaid`; `snapshot.spells`
  carries them; `src/renderer/town/spellsView.ts` draws them (looks per spell in `town/spellLooks.ts`: bolts,
  streams, roots, rain, fog, rings, domes, arrows, flasks...), above the day-and-night tint so they glow.
- **The vampire castle:** `castle` in an origin's rules (the Blood Court). `src/shared/sim/castle.ts`: the keep's span
  over the camp (`castleSpan`), which buildings are rooms (`roomKind`), floors (`Building.room`/`floor`; `canPlace`
  checks overlap per floor), `openFloors`, `roomOf` (the room someone's in: `PersonView.floor`), `adoptRooms` for
  older saves. The planner's `roomSpot` fills it. Drawn by `src/renderer/art/castle.ts` (`roomArt` cutaways, `keepArt`
  shell, sliced per 16px in `BuildingsView.syncCastle`); `mobile.ts` zooms and grows the strip so the keep fits.
  - The keep widens each era (`castleWidth`: 16 tiles, 4 more per era). Nothing that belongs inside sprawls: with no
    room in the keep the planner clears the keep's ground or waits for it to grow. Wells, stables and racks are rooms
    too (`OUTSIDE` keeps only mines, the graveyard and the launch site out).
  - Floors are real: `Person.floor`/`climb` and `Raider.floor`/`climb`. A stair tower stands at each end of the keep
    (`stairXs`, drawn as an open stairwell in `keepArt`); `moveOnFloors` walks to the nearer one, climbs a floor per
    `CLIMB_SECONDS`, then walks along. People use it through `goTo`/`goToB` in `people.ts`; defenders fight only on their
    foe's floor. Raiders strike only on their own floor, weigh a climb (`FLOOR_COST`) in choosing a target, break the
    walls on the ground first, climb after the townsfolk, and come down before they flee. `PersonView.floor` and
    `RaiderView.floor` are how high up they are (fractional on the stairs).
- **Spell sprites:** `SPELL_SHEET_DEFS` in `art/effects.ts` (pvfx and Alenia sheets), matched to spells by `sprite` in
  `town/spellLooks.ts` and placed by `SHEETS` in `spellsView.ts` (foot offset, frame rate, glow). Rival troops use
  the golem/elemental stills (`elem_*`) and strip sheets with a `feet` share (`creatures.ts`).
- **Beasts and lurkers:** biome-only raid kinds (`biomes` on a `RaidKind`: lions, wild dogs, crocodiles); the
  Behemoth joins beast raids (`BEAST_RAIDS` in raids.ts). `src/shared/sim/lurkers.ts`: raids that start inside the
  town (`startRaid(..., inside)`: the Mimic at the shop by night, possessed tomes at a library) and their rewards
  (`lurkersBeaten`, from `endRaid`).
- **The nomads' seasonal round:** `nomadic` in an origin's rules. `src/shared/sim/nomads.ts`: `s.nomad` (home ground,
  summer pasture, current camp; `campX` follows the camp), `updateNomads` (moves at midsummer and midwinter, by day;
  settles in the Industrial era), `moveCamp` (`PORTABLE` tents move and are re-pitched as blueprints at `PITCHED`),
  `buildOrigin` (rooted great works go on the home ground), the wagon circle (`circleWagons` at a raid warning; the
  `wagon_circle` def is `never` built by the planner) and no walls while nomadic. The renderer follows the caravan
  (`snapshot.nomad.move`). Their tents and the settled caravan city's adobe are in `src/renderer/art/nomadArt.ts`
  (style `nomads_city` once `snapshot.nomad.settled`); parked wagons and old camp marks (`nomad.left`) in animalsView.
- **Origin buildings:** `src/renderer/art/originStyles.ts`: each origin's own homes, walls and gates; every other
  building gets its materials swapped (`reclad`) and dressing on top. `buildingArt` takes the style (the theme id).
- **Research, doubled:** general topics per era and a six-topic **heritage** line per origin (`origin` on a `Topic`,
  branch `heritage`; built with `T()`/`heritage()` in `data/research.ts`, whose `unlocks` text comes from
  `describeEffects`). New effect kinds: `rule` (the origin levers: build, craft, travellers, prices, fight, guard,
  day, night; multiplied in by `sim/origin.ts` through the cached `researchMods`), `quality` and `powers` (recharge
  and duration, in `castPowers`). `prereqsMet`/`canQueue`/`queueResearch` take the town's origin; another origin's
  heritage is refused (`foreignHeritage`). The Research tab's Hide toggles are kept in `localStorage`
  (`littletown.researchHide`).
- **Animal husbandry (Phase 4 begun):** pens in the background (`chicken_coop`, `goat_pen` from Domestication;
  `pig_sty`, `sheep_fold`, `cattle_pasture` from Animal Husbandry), their herds in `data/livestock.ts` (`HERDS`) and
  `sim/livestock.ts` (`b.herd`; `tendHerds` hourly: breeding, winter fodder, starving; `workPen`, tended through the
  Farm job's `farm` task after the fields; `rustle` when raiders get away). New materials `eggs`, `milk` (food),
  `wool` (spun into cloth at the loom). The animals are drawn by `town/herdsView.ts` (`art/livestockArt.ts`) in the
  background layer.
- **The background clears with the land:** `backNow`/`backOpen` in `sim/buildings.ts`: a forest, hills or marsh
  column behind a cleared tile is `cleared`, and background buildings can go there (never on a river). TownView
  draws the background per column (`b<i>` groups) and rebuilds a column when its tile clears.
- **The far wall:** `enclosure()` (sim/buildings.ts; `snapshot.enclosure`): walls finished beyond both ends of the
  town. `art/farWall.ts` draws it in the background's far depth, in the weaker end's material.
- **Terrain art:** `art/terrain.ts` paints each walkway and midground tile as one texture (road with ruts, stones,
  puddles and a verge; footpaths; forest floor; cobbles; marsh pools), continuous across tiles via `noise()` on
  world x. `art/sprites.ts` has the scenery (trees with bark and leaf clusters, stumps, logs, ferns, mushrooms);
  the background has mountains and a wooded ridge, hedgerows, furrows, river banks.
- **Offline pacing:** `awayPlayMs` in `sim/offline.ts`: the first half hour away passes as in play, the rest at a
  quarter pace, and at most 1 game day passes for one absence (`MAX_OFFLINE_MS`).
- **Raids wait for you:** `src/shared/sim/raidWait.ts`. During the catch-up after time away, raiders reaching the gate
  hold there (`holdAtGate`: `Raid.waiting`, the town paused, a `gate` prompt, "Watch the fight", with no countdown);
  answering it or unpausing lets them in (`openGate`). Held more than `RAID_WAIT_MS` (12 real hours, across visits), or
  away that long after they came, and the raid plays out alone (`Raid.alone`). Phone alerts (ntfy) are shared by both
  apps: `src/shared/alerts.ts` (`plan` looks one absence ahead with the forecast, stops at the first raid, and times
  them by the away pace, `awayRealMs`); the phone page books them when it goes to the background and drops them when
  it comes back (`mobileBridge.ts`, keys `littletown.alerts`, `littletown.scheduledAlerts`); the panel is in the ☰
  menu.
- **Hide toggles:** `panel/hide.ts` (`HidePrefs`): Research, Build and Crafting each have a "Hide:" row, kept in
  `localStorage` (`littletown.researchHide`, `buildHide`, `craftHide`).
- **Upgrades and fewer homes:** `UPGRADES` in `data/buildings.ts` (homes: lean-to or hide tent → longhouse →
  cottage → row houses → apartments → dome; research stations; healer's hut → infirmary; watchtower → radio tower →
  drone hub). `upgrade(s, back, id, absorb?)` in `sim/buildings.ts` can pull down a neighbour of the same kind and make
  the two one (two lean-tos become a longhouse). The planner's `consolidateHomes`: when beds are wanted it rebuilds a
  small home bigger before building another; in a quiet spell it upgrades one anyway (up to `SLEEP_ROUGH` sleep out
  meanwhile). New homes are paced by beds (`lastHomeBeds`), so bigger homes don't speed growth. Soak: about 10 homes
  (mostly longhouses) for 30 people at day 15, where it was about 28.
- **Choice events:** the 100 of `EVENTS.md` are data in `src/shared/data/events.ts` (`EVENTS`: title, text, `who`
  for a townsperson in it, `when`, two or three options with one `default`, each a list of `EventEffect`s: notes,
  morale and lever marks, gains and losses, coins, renown, newcomers, leaving, deaths and wounds, sickness, raids
  sooner or later, research, the Occult, chances and `later` effects). `src/shared/sim/events.ts`: `maybeEvent` hourly
  (one at a time, `EVENT_GAP_HOURS` apart, none repeated within 25), a prompt of kind `event` that waits
  `EVENT_HOURS` in play and holds its clock while the town is caught up (`holdEventClock`), `answerEvent`. Marks are
  `s.marks`: a lever's are multiplied in by `markMult` in `sim/origin.ts`, morale ones join `mood()`. The tests'
  `plainGame` turns events off.
- **Rally and held powers:** `src/shared/sim/rally.ts`: in a raid a defender's tap card offers **Rally!** (the `rally`
  command): harder, faster blows for `RALLY_TICKS` (`p.rallied`, read by `defenderAttack` and `doDefend`), a second
  wind, then a town-wide cooldown (`s.rallyReady`); the rallied pulse gold (peopleView). `PersonView.rally` and
  `snapshot.rallyIn` drive the card. A power held back (`s.heldPower`, `holdPower`/`castHeld` in `powers.ts`; the Plan
  tab's Hold back / Cast now) is never cast by the town; in a raid a button by the clock casts it (`hud.ts`).
- **Fonts:** `src/renderer/fonts.ts`: a display and a body font for each look (`FONTS`, keyed by theme id; `town` is
  the base game), Google Fonts (OFL) bundled from @fontsource by `build.mjs` into `fonts/` (so they work offline).
  `theme.ts` declares the faces on every page and sets `--font-display`/`--font-body` (a theme overrides the two);
  the pages' CSS uses the variables, never a font name. Titles, headings and tabs take the display font.
- **Phase 4:** more farming.

## Planned (owner's requests, not started)

- **Shop and tavern interiors at an angle:** the `shop` and `tavern` panels (`panel/shopPanel.ts`) should show a
  three-quarter, angled view of the room instead of the bird's-eye one, so the townsfolk and travellers can be drawn
  with their ordinary side-on sprites (LPC characters) as they come in to shop, dine and sleep.

- **Twice the scenery detail:** on top of the terrain redraw (`art/terrain.ts`, `art/sprites.ts`, the background in
  `town/townView.ts`), double the detail again: more kinds of scenery (bushes, flowers, rocks, grass tufts, fallen
  leaves, puddles, birds), denser and more varied trees, textured mountains and hills, per-season and per-biome
  variants, small animated touches (swaying grass, drifting leaves, smoke). Check it at phone sizes and keep the
  frame rate up on the phone. **Textures first** (the owner: "adding textures will go a long ways"): grain, noise,
  dithering and material patterns on every surface (ground, grass, bark, rock, thatch, stone, timber, water, hills), not
  flat fills.

- **More to watch, not more to do** (the town still decides everything; these give the player moments):
  1. and 2. are done (raids wait for you; time away capped at a game day: see above).
  3. is done (choice events: see above).
  4. and 5. are done (rally in a fight; hold a power: see above).
  6. **Morning report card:** on return, a short illustrated strip of the three biggest things that happened.
  7. **Follow a hero:** pin one townsperson; the camera follows them, and their life's big moments send alerts.
  8. **Expedition stakes:** one choice as a party leaves (safe or risky), the rest planned by the town.

## Known problem (fixed, watch)

- **Slow growth after the livestock change** was the planner counting hide as available because a goat pen can be
  culled (`sourceable` in `planner.ts`). Pens are culled only when full or short of food, so towns queued buildings that
  cost hide and nobody could supply it. Now only pens kept for meat count. Soak (8 towns, 15 days): druids 27.5,
  dwarves 30.1, settlers 20.9. Two of eight druid towns died out; not yet compared with the old build.

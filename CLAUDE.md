# Chronos Settlement (formerly Little Town)

A pixel-art town that runs itself, like an ant farm. It's played mainly as a phone web app (a PWA on the
owner's Android, hosted on GitHub Pages). There's also a Windows desktop overlay (Electron): a strip above the
taskbar. TypeScript + PixiJS. `DESIGN.md` is the original design, and `README.md` covers how to play and build.

## Priorities (from the owner)

- **Phone first.** Design every change for the phone version. Before calling anything done, check it at phone
  sizes both upright (393x852) and sideways (852x393) in a browser preview.
- **Hands-off.** The town decides for itself what to research, gather, build and craft
  (`src/shared/sim/planner.ts`). The player only sets the town's **direction** (Growth, Defence, Trade or
  Knowledge, in the Plan tab) and sends **expeditions**. Don't add chores or manual controls.
- **Deaths should be common.** Raids, disasters and hunger are meant to bite.
- **Assets.** The project is free and private, so any sprite from the asset packs may be used. Credit the source
  in `CREDITS.md`. The packs live in the private repo `hpatter9/chronos-assets` (clone it next to this one, at
  `../chronos-assets`); copy in only the individual sprites the game uses, never whole packs. Sprites the game uses
  are in `src`. Images load through `art/loadImage.ts` (a refused `decode()` falls back to the load event).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit
npm test               # headless sim tests (node test runner)
npm run web            # build the phone version into out/web (what GitHub Pages serves)
npm run build          # build only (desktop + renderer) into out/
npm run dist           # Windows installer (needs Windows; not for the cloud)
```

To preview the phone version, serve `out/web` with any static server and open it at a phone size.
`window.__game` is the game loop (`__game.sim.step()` fast-forwards), and `window.bridge.openPanel('build')`
opens a menu. Never launch Electron; the owner runs the desktop app themselves.

## Layout

- `src/shared/sim/`: the deterministic simulation. It runs at 10 ticks a second, with 600 ticks per game hour
  and 3-day seasons.
  - `sim.ts`: the step order.
  - `planner.ts`: the self-running town. It can be turned off with `state.autopilot = false`; the tests' `plainGame`
    helper does this.
  - `people.ts`: jobs and tasks.
  - `snapshot.ts`: what the renderers see.
  - `save.ts`: save versions and migrations.
- `src/shared/data/`: buildings, research, items, the world map spots, founding (backgrounds and scenarios), and
  so on.
- `src/renderer/`: the town strip.
  - `main.ts`: input, the phone's tap card and pinch.
  - `town/`: the views: sky, weather, seasons (via `art/palette.ts`).
  - `panel/`: the menus.
  - `mobile/`: the phone page. It holds the strip and the menus in two iframes that share one bridge;
    `mobileBridge.ts` runs the game in the page and saves to `localStorage`.
- `src/main/`: the Electron desktop app.
- `tools/build-web.mjs`: the phone build (manifest, offline service worker, icons).

## Conventions

- Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` after changes, and add tests for new rules in `test/`.
- After CSS changes, check the braces balance and that each `@media` block holds only what it should. A broken
  `@media` block once wrecked the phone layout.
- Saves on the phone use the keys `littletown.*`, and the desktop uses `%APPDATA%\Little Town`. Keep both, or
  existing towns are lost.

## Current work: the ant-farm redesign

- **Phase 1 is done:** the self-running town, direction, and a zoomed-out phone view with pinch-to-zoom.
- **Phase 2 is done:** coins and a shop (`src/shared/sim/shop.ts`, data in `src/shared/data/shop.ts`).
  - The planner researches Barter and builds a Trading Post, which grows by upgrade (General Store, then Emporium).
    Straight away if the land can't give what it needs (`unsourced`).
  - It crafts furnishings (items with `furnish` in `data/items.ts`), and the shopkeeper (an operator role) sets them
    out on the shop's floor grid (`shopLayout`). Appeal: more travellers, bigger purses.
  - Travellers (`s.travellers`) walk in, trade at the shop, and walk out. The planner decides what's for sale
    (`forSale`) and what to buy (`shoppingList`). Materials travellers sell count as sourceable once there's a
    shop, which is how desert towns get fiber.
  - Attractiveness (`attractiveness()`: appeal plus `s.renown`) sets the customer tiers that come (`CUSTOMER_TIERS` in
    `data/shop.ts`: travellers, merchants, nobles, magnates). Higher tiers want wares (items with `ware` in
    `data/items.ts`, unlocked by research). Served, renown rises; disappointed, it falls.
  - The planner makes wares from spare materials only, spends coins on the shop (`planShop`: extensions when crowded,
    else piece levels), and weights research toward wares for tiers it draws but can't serve (`wareGaps`).
  - Venues are general (`floor.venue` in `data/buildings.ts`: `shop` or `tavern`; the tavern chain is Fireside Inn →
    Tavern). They start bare; furnishings are commissioned (`CraftOrder.for`) only when the town can pay, and crafters
    are paid (`payCrafter` in `crafting.ts`). Renown, the log and unmet wants (`asked`) live on each venue's `b.shop`.
  - Strangers (`Traveller`) have a name, temper and `want`; keepers upsell on Social (`talkChance`). Tavern guests need
    comfort (`req`).
  - Quality (`data/quality.ts`, 8 grades) is rolled from Crafting skill; inventory qualities live in `s.itemQ`
    (kept in step by `qualitiesOf`), worn ones in `p.gearQ`.
  - Wages and gear buying: `sim/wages.ts`. With a shop, `equipAll`/`pickTool` stop handing gear out. The daily ledger
    is `s.ledger` (`earn` in `state.ts`); per-person activity is `p.recent` (`remember`).
  - Research: one person per station (`researchStations`, `freeStation`, `topicFor` in `research.ts`); the research
    task carries its station and topic.
  - The lich path: `offerLichRite`/`chooseLich`/`watchLich` in `occult.ts`, `s.lichChosen` then `s.lich` (permanent).
    `snapshot.theme` is `'lich'` once it's set; `src/renderer/theme.ts` holds the look (one stylesheet scoped to
    `html.theme-lich`) and the menus' new names, applied by the phone page, the panels and the strip's HUD.
  - The bird's-eye interior is the `shop` and `tavern` panels (`src/renderer/panel/shopPanel.ts`), opened by tapping the shop.
  - All the new state fields are optional (no save version bump): old saves load with no coins and no shop.
- **Menus take the whole screen on the phone** (the `menu-open` class in `mobile/index.html`): the town runs
  itself, so there's little to watch while a menu is open. The tabs stay visible (along the bottom upright).
- **Phase 3 is done** (the Tavern: see above).
- **Origins are done:** `src/shared/data/origins.ts` (defs: start, rules, powers), applied at founding in
  `newGame`; the rule multipliers are in `src/shared/sim/origin.ts` (asked for by people, farming, raids, crafting, the
  shop, townsfolk); powers in `src/shared/sim/powers.ts` (`castPowers`, cast by the town itself; buffs in `s.buffs`);
  looks in `src/renderer/theme.ts` (one palette per origin, CSS generated and scoped to `html.theme-<id>`, menu names,
  building tint), and each origin's menu materials and shapes in `src/renderer/skins.ts` (appended to the theme's
  CSS: small inline SVGs; use `pseudo()` to put `::after` on a selector list). Undead and machines are both
  `tireless` (state.ts).
- **Rival origins are done:** `src/shared/data/rivals.ts` (each origin's lord, army and hostile spells), raid kinds
  `rival_*` in `data/raids.ts` (with `origin` and `leader`; never picked for the town's own origin), enemies and
  relics in `data/enemies.ts` and `data/items.ts`. `src/shared/sim/rivals.ts` casts the lords' spells
  (`rivalsInRaid`) and holds the hexes on `Raid.hex` that raids.ts and powers.ts read (`heldBack`, `fogAim`,
  `wardOf`, `frenzyOf`, `turretsDown`).
- **Spell visuals:** casts are recorded with `castSpellFx` (state.ts: caster, targets by id, how long) from
  `castPowers` (the `TOUCH` table in powers.ts says what each power touches) and `rivalsInRaid`; `snapshot.spells`
  carries them; `src/renderer/town/spellsView.ts` draws them (looks per spell in `town/spellLooks.ts`: bolts,
  streams, roots, rain, fog, rings, domes, arrows, flasks...), above the day-and-night tint so they glow.
- **The vampire castle:** `castle` in an origin's rules (the Blood Court). `src/shared/sim/castle.ts`: the keep's span
  over the camp (`castleSpan`), which buildings are rooms (`roomKind`), floors (`Building.room`/`floor`; `canPlace`
  checks overlap per floor), `openFloors`, `roomOf` (the room someone's in: `PersonView.floor`), `adoptRooms` for
  older saves. The planner's `roomSpot` fills it. Drawn by `src/renderer/art/castle.ts` (`roomArt` cutaways, `keepArt`
  shell, sliced per 16px in `BuildingsView.syncCastle`); `mobile.ts` zooms and grows the strip so the keep fits.
- **Spell sprites:** `SPELL_SHEET_DEFS` in `art/effects.ts` (pvfx and Alenia sheets), matched to spells by `sprite` in
  `town/spellLooks.ts` and placed by `SHEETS` in `spellsView.ts` (foot offset, frame rate, glow). Rival troops use
  the golem/elemental stills (`elem_*`) and strip sheets with a `feet` share (`creatures.ts`).
- **Beasts and lurkers:** biome-only raid kinds (`biomes` on a `RaidKind`: lions, wild dogs, crocodiles); the
  Behemoth joins beast raids (`BEAST_RAIDS` in raids.ts). `src/shared/sim/lurkers.ts`: raids that start inside the
  town (`startRaid(..., inside)`: the Mimic at the shop by night, possessed tomes at a library) and their rewards
  (`lurkersBeaten`, from `endRaid`).
- **The nomads' seasonal round:** `nomadic` in an origin's rules. `src/shared/sim/nomads.ts`: `s.nomad` (home ground,
  summer pasture, current camp; `campX` follows the camp), `updateNomads` (moves at midsummer and midwinter, by day;
  settles in the Industrial era), `moveCamp` (`PORTABLE` tents move and are re-pitched as blueprints at `PITCHED`),
  `buildOrigin` (rooted great works go on the home ground), the wagon circle (`circleWagons` at a raid warning; the
  `wagon_circle` def is `never` built by the planner) and no walls while nomadic. The renderer follows the caravan
  (`snapshot.nomad.move`). Their tents and the settled caravan city's adobe are in `src/renderer/art/nomadArt.ts`
  (style `nomads_city` once `snapshot.nomad.settled`); parked wagons and old camp marks (`nomad.left`) in animalsView.
- **Origin buildings:** `src/renderer/art/originStyles.ts`: each origin's own homes, walls and gates; every other
  building gets its materials swapped (`reclad`) and dressing on top. `buildingArt` takes the style (the theme id).
- **Research, doubled:** general topics per era and a six-topic **heritage** line per origin (`origin` on a `Topic`,
  branch `heritage`; built with `T()`/`heritage()` in `data/research.ts`, whose `unlocks` text comes from
  `describeEffects`). New effect kinds: `rule` (the origin levers: build, craft, travellers, prices, fight, guard,
  day, night; multiplied in by `sim/origin.ts` through the cached `researchMods`), `quality` and `powers` (recharge
  and duration, in `castPowers`). `prereqsMet`/`canQueue`/`queueResearch` take the town's origin; another origin's
  heritage is refused (`foreignHeritage`). The Research tab's Hide toggles are kept in `localStorage`
  (`littletown.researchHide`).
- **Animal husbandry (Phase 4 begun):** pens in the background (`chicken_coop`, `goat_pen` from Domestication;
  `pig_sty`, `sheep_fold`, `cattle_pasture` from Animal Husbandry), their herds in `data/livestock.ts` (`HERDS`) and
  `sim/livestock.ts` (`b.herd`; `tendHerds` hourly: breeding, winter fodder, starving; `workPen`, tended through the
  Farm job's `farm` task after the fields; `rustle` when raiders get away). New materials `eggs`, `milk` (food),
  `wool` (spun into cloth at the loom). The animals are drawn by `town/herdsView.ts` (`art/livestockArt.ts`) in the
  background layer.
- **The background clears with the land:** `backNow`/`backOpen` in `sim/buildings.ts`: a forest, hills or marsh
  column behind a cleared tile is `cleared`, and background buildings can go there (never on a river). TownView
  draws the background per column (`b<i>` groups) and rebuilds a column when its tile clears.
- **The far wall:** `enclosure()` (sim/buildings.ts; `snapshot.enclosure`): walls finished beyond both ends of the
  town. `art/farWall.ts` draws it in the background's far depth, in the weaker end's material.
- **Terrain art:** `art/terrain.ts` paints each walkway and midground tile as one texture (road with ruts, stones,
  puddles and a verge; footpaths; forest floor; cobbles; marsh pools), continuous across tiles via `noise()` on
  world x. `art/sprites.ts` has the scenery (trees with bark and leaf clusters, stumps, logs, ferns, mushrooms);
  the background has mountains and a wooded ridge, hedgerows, furrows, river banks.
- **Offline pacing:** `awayPlayMs` in `sim/offline.ts`: the first half hour away passes as in play, the rest at a
  quarter pace, and at most 3 game days pass for one absence.
- **Hide toggles:** `panel/hide.ts` (`HidePrefs`): Research, Build and Crafting each have a "Hide:" row, kept in
  `localStorage` (`littletown.researchHide`, `buildHide`, `craftHide`).
- **Phase 4:** more farming.

## Planned (owner's requests, not started)

- **Shop and tavern interiors at an angle:** the `shop` and `tavern` panels (`panel/shopPanel.ts`) should show a
  three-quarter, angled view of the room instead of the bird's-eye one, so the townsfolk and travellers can be drawn
  with their ordinary side-on sprites (LPC characters) as they come in to shop, dine and sleep.

- **Upgradable buildings (part of the next change):** houses and any other building where it makes sense (workshops,
  storehouses, farms, the well, the school, the walls) upgrade in place to a bigger, better-looking version as the
  town progresses (eras and research), instead of the town sprawling into many small houses. The town decides when
  (planner, from coins and materials; no manual controls). An upgraded home holds more people, so the planner
  builds fewer homes; the art changes per tier (`art/buildings.ts`, origin styles in `art/originStyles.ts`). Shops
  already grow this way (Trading Post → General Store → Emporium; Fireside Inn → Tavern); reuse that upgrade
  mechanism. Needs: tier data on `data/buildings.ts`, save-safe (optional fields), planner rules, tests, and a look
  at phone sizes.

- **More to watch, not more to do** (the town still decides everything; these give the player moments):
  1. **Raids wait for you:** when a raid is about to start and nobody is watching, the town pauses and a phone alert
     (ntfy) says raiders are at the gate; a **Watch the fight** button starts it. It waits at most ~12 real hours,
     then plays out alone. (Alternative kept in mind: a replay of an unwatched raid, key moments slowed.)
  2. **Time away capped at 1 game day** (`MAX_OFFLINE_MS` in `sim/offline.ts`, now 3 days).
  3. **Choices that wait for you:** more events that stop and ask, each with a time limit and a default so the town
     never stalls (like the lich rite): a stranger asks to join; a raider chief offers terms (tribute or fight); a sick
     traveller begs shelter (plague risk); a deserter from a rival origin's army; a merchant offers a rare relic for
     most of the coins; twins born, name one after a hero; a duel for the founder's honour; a comet (omen: a ritual
     or ignore it); a flood or fire threatens the fields or the stores (save one); a prisoner offers a secret for
     freedom; the guild offers a contract (send people away for a big reward); townsfolk quarrel (whose side); an
     old ruin found nearby (dig now, or seal it); a wandering monster's lair (hunt it or leave it be). The full list of 100
     events to draw from at random is in `EVENTS.md`.
  4. **Rally in a fight:** tap a defender to rally them (a burst of courage, cooldown).
  5. **Hold a power:** the player can keep one of the origin's powers back and cast it themselves in a raid.
  6. **Morning report card:** on return, a short illustrated strip of the three biggest things that happened.
  7. **Follow a hero:** pin one townsperson; the camera follows them, and their life's big moments send alerts.
  8. **Expedition stakes:** one choice as a party leaves (safe or risky), the rest planned by the town.

## Known problem (fixed, watch)

- **Slow growth after the livestock change** was the planner counting hide as available because a goat pen can be
  culled (`sourceable` in `planner.ts`). Pens are culled only when full or short of food, so towns queued buildings that
  cost hide and nobody could supply it. Now only pens kept for meat count. Soak (8 towns, 15 days): druids 27.5,
  dwarves 30.1, settlers 20.9. Two of eight druid towns died out; not yet compared with the old build.
